# Settings Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed

### iOS App (TCA-Compliant)
- **Settings Feature** - Full TCA implementation with tree-based navigation
- **User Profile Display** - Shows name and email from API
- **Sign Out** - Clears auth state and returns to login
- **Delete Account** - Removes account with confirmation
- **Sub-screens** - About, Privacy Policy, Data Management
- **Alert Handling** - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- **API Integration** - Connected to all backend endpoints

### Backend Fixes
- **Fixed 500 Error** - Added default `is_active=True` in `/users/me` endpoint
- **All Auth Endpoints Working** - Register, login, logout, delete account

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Changes Needed

### Railway Environment Variables
```bash
# Current (WRONG):
ENABLE_AUTH_BYPASS=true

# Should be:
ENABLE_AUTH_BYPASS=false
```

### Impact of Current Issue
- All users see "Development User" instead of their real name
- Email shows "dev@example.com" instead of actual email
- This is purely a configuration issue - code is correct

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

### iOS App
- `SettingsView.swift` - Main Settings implementation
- `AppFeature.swift` - Integration with app navigation
- `ProfileHeaderView.swift` - User info display
- `SettingsRowView.swift` - Reusable row component

### Backend
- `app/routers/users.py` - Fixed `is_active` field issue

## üß™ Testing

Despite bypass data, all features work:
- User info loads from API
- Sign out clears session
- Delete account removes user
- Navigation and UI function correctly

Once `ENABLE_AUTH_BYPASS=false` is set in production, users will see their actual data.
