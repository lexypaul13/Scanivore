# Backend Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint was returning 500 Internal Server Error due to:
- The `UserResponse` model expecting an `is_active` field
- The database `User` model not having this field
- Resulting in `AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'is_active'`

## Solution Applied
Modified `/users/me` endpoint in `app/routers/users.py`:
- Set `is_active=True` as default in both GET and PUT endpoints
- Lines 50 and 154 in the file

## Deployment Status
- Changes committed and pushed to `migration-to-personal` branch
- Railway should auto-deploy within a few minutes
- Check deployment status at Railway dashboard

## How to Verify Fix

### 1. Quick Test Script
```bash
python3 test_backend_fix.py
```

This will:
- Login with test account
- Call `/users/me` endpoint
- Show if 500 error is fixed

### 2. Manual Test
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST https://clear-meat-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test_settings_013352@example.com&password=TestPass123!"

# Get user profile (use token from login response)
curl https://clear-meat-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. iOS App Test
Once the backend is deployed:
1. Revert temporary test data in `AppFeature.swift`
2. Uncomment `.onAppear` in `SettingsView.swift`
3. Run the app and login
4. Navigate to Settings tab
5. Should see "John Settings Test" instead of "Guest User"

## Expected Timeline
- Push to GitHub: âœ… Complete
- Railway deployment: ~2-5 minutes
- Testing: Can begin once deployed

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Railway deployment
2. Run `test_backend_fix.py` to verify
3. Test in iOS app
4. Remove all temporary test code
